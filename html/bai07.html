      A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at
      the sides of the mouth. It is <br />
      believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a
      contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, <br />
      an action known as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye
      contraction may be perceived as insincere.
